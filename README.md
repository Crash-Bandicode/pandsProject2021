Using Python to investigate a Dataset

In this project I investigate the Iris Data set using various modules and libraries in Python, using Jupyter Notebook as the coderunner. 

I initially discuss the use of linear regression, using a matplotlib pairplot to illustrate the spread of data in the data set and the shorcomings of this approach.

I then investigated the different variables using pandas and considered how the problem might be solved by contemplating the interactions of the four dimensions.

I then move on to use scikitlearn to use the KNN machine learning technique to finally separate out the other two species based on much more accurate predictions.
